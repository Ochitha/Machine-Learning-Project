# Machine-Learning-Project
Machine learning models were created for Unsupervised learning, Regression and Classification tasks using different datasets for each. Further, research questions were introduced followed by literature reviews to answer these problem, all highlighted in a detailed report. The links for each dataset are provided in the compiled notebook under Tasks 1, 2 and 3.

All the models were built using python.


Task 1 (Unsupervised learning) makes use of the shop customer dataset which represents a thorough examination of an imaginative storeâ€™s hypothetical clients, containing 2000 observations and 8 variables, such as customer ID, Age, Annual Income in $ and Profession. Principal Component Analysis was used as a dimension reduction technique for the data and helped identify the most important components. K-Means clustering was also used to find clusters between each of the identified principal components.

Task 2 (Regression) made use of a used car dataset highlighting the brands of used cars including the kilometres they have driven, the gear transmission, the fuel type and many more, out of which it would be possible to create a regression model to predict prices. Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, LightGBM and XGBoost Regression methods were utilised, and performance evaluators were used such as R-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Task 3 (Classification) used the famous Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Decision tree classifier, logisitic regression, XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost were applied and were evaluated through the metrics of accuracy, precision, Recall and F1 scores. Confusion matrices for each were created and the ROC curve was illustrated to find the individual AUCs for each model.
